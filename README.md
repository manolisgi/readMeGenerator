## **Project Description**
When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

## **Installation Instructions**
You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.
    
## **Usage Information**
a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

## **License**
Licensed under the mit license

## **Contributing**
If you want to contribute to someone else's project but don't have write access to the repository, you can use a "fork and pull request" workflow.

## **Tests**
The scope of testing is generally an extension of the requirement analysis phase and mostly considered as a single activity, since they go hand in hand. Once the requirements are out, the test team determines what items are to be tested and what not.
